					<h3>TL;DR Version</h3>
					<p>Don't be a tool. Don't post illegal stuff. Don't sue us. We can ban you whenever we want. Your memes belong to everyone now.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="terms-card">
					<h3>Acceptance of Terms</h3>
					<p>By accessing Based.meme, you agree to be bound by these terms, all applicable laws, and the unwritten rules of internet culture. If you disagree, you are welcome to leave and go back to Reddit or Instagram.</p>
					<p>By using this site, you also agree that you have read these terms, which we know you haven't. Nice try.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="terms-card">
					<h3>Account Registration</h3>
					<p>To become a member of our dysfunctional family, you must:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Be at least 13.42 years old (mentally, not just chronologically).</li>
						<li>Create a username that makes us question your life choices.</li>
						<li>Provide an email address that you actually check.</li>
						<li>Pass our rigorous "Are you based?" test.</li>
					</ul>
					<p>You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your password, even though it's probably "password123."</p>
				</div>
				<div class="terms-card">
					<h3>User Conduct</h3>
					<p>You agree NOT to use Based.meme to:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Post anything illegal (we're not going to jail for your memes).</li>
						<li>Harass other users (unless they're being exceptionally cringe).</li>
						<li>Spam (unless it's actually funny, which it never is).</li>
						<li>Post normie content (this is a bannable offense).</li>
						<li>Attempt to monetize your memes (capitalism is cringe).</li>
						<li>Promote your SoundCloud/TikTok/OnlyFans (literally no one cares).</li>
					</ul>
				</div>
				<div class="terms-card">
					<h3>Content Guidelines</h3>
					<p>All content must be:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>At least marginally funny to someone, somewhere.</li>
						<li>Original or stolen so well we can't tell the difference.</li>
						<li>Not boring (subjectively determined by our meme researcher).</li>
					</ul>
					<p>We will remove content that is:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Actually illegal (not just morally questionable).</li>
						<li>So unfunny it causes physical pain.</li>
						<li>Something your grandma would post on Facebook.</li>
					</ul>
				</div>
				<div class="terms-card">
