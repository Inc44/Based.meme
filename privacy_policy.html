			<h2 class="tagline">Privacy Policy</h2>
			<p class="subtitle">Yes, we actually have one of these.</p>
			<div class="policy-content">
				<div class="policy-card">
					<h3>TL;DR Version</h3>
					<p>We collect just enough data to make the site work and to have something to sell when we inevitably get acquired by a soul-sucking tech giant.</p>
					<p>Just kidding. Mostly.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="policy-card">
					<h3>What We Collect</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>Your username (we judge you for it).</li>
						<li>Your email (we promise not to spam you... much).</li>
						<li>Your IP address (we need to know where to send the pizza).</li>
						<li>Your meme browsing history (for science).</li>
						<li>How long you stare at each meme (seriously, get help).</li>
						<li>The number of times you've exhaled sharply through your nose while browsing.</li>
					</ul>
				</div>
				<div class="policy-card">
					<h3>What We Do With It</h3>
					<p>We use your data to:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Improve our meme recommendation algorithm (it's still garbage).</li>
						<li>Send you notifications when someone thinks you're funny (rare).</li>
						<li>Track your descent into increasingly niche meme subcultures.</li>
						<li>Occasionally show you ads for products you'll never buy.</li>
						<li>Create anonymous statistics about which memes make people exhale the hardest.</li>
					</ul>
				</div>
				<div class="policy-card">
					<h3>Third-Party Sharing</h3>
					<p>We don't sell your data because:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>We're not that desperate (yet).</li>
						<li>Nobody wants to know what you're laughing at.</li>
						<li>We're trying to maintain the illusion that we have principles.</li>
					</ul>
					<p>Exceptions include:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>If we get a court order (lol).</li>
						<li>If someone offers us a truly ridiculous amount of money.</li>
						<li>If you post something so cringe it requires scientific study.</li>
					</ul>
				</div>
				<div class="policy-card">
					<h3>Your Rights</h3>
					<p>You have the right to:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Ask us what data we have on you.</li>
						<li>Request deletion of your data (we'll pretend to do it).</li>
						<li>Export your data (it's just a text file of all the memes you've upvoted).</li>
						<li>Complain about our privacy practices (we'll add it to the pile).</li>
						<li>Leave anytime (but where else will you get your meme fix?).</li>
					</ul>
				</div>
				<div class="policy-card">
					<h3>Cookies</h3>
					<p>Our site uses cookies to remember your preferences and login status. We also use them to judge your taste in memes.</p>
					<p>If you disable cookies, the site will still work, but it will ask you if you're a cop every time you visit. (Cops legally have to tell us if they're cops.)</p>
				</div>
				<div class="policy-card">
					<h3>Security</h3>
					<p>We protect your data with:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>A very strong password (it's "password123").</li>
						<li>A server in someone's basement.</li>
						<li>A security guard (it's a cat named Miles).</li>
						<li>Encryption (we think).</li>
					</ul>
					<p>In case of a breach, we will notify you by posting a meme about it.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="policy-card">
					<h3>Changes to This Policy</h3>
					<p>We reserve the right to change this policy whenever we feel like it. We'll notify you by updating the date at the bottom of this page and hoping you notice.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="policy-card">
					<h3>Contact Us</h3>
					<p>If you have questions about this policy, please contact our Data Protection Officer:</p>
					<p>Email: noprivacy@based.meme</p>
					<p>Carrier Pigeon: Please don't.</p>
